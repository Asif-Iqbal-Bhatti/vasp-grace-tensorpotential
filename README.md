# vasp-grace-tensorpotential

**vasp-grace** is a lightweight Python interface that enables the use of **GRACE Machine Learning Potentials** as a drop-in replacement for the VASP executable. By emulating VASP’s input/output behavior, it integrates seamlessly with established atomistic simulation workflows that rely on VASP-compatible formats.

## Key Features

- **VASP-Compatible Interface**  
  Fully supports standard VASP input files such as `POSCAR` and `INCAR`, allowing existing workflows to run without modification.

- **Geometry Optimization**  
  Implements structural optimization via ASE, with support for common VASP tags such as `IBRION` and `ISIF`.

- **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**  
  Enables MD simulations through ASE with GRACE potentials.

- **Phonon and elastic constants**  
  Enabels Phonon calculation Band Strucutre and Density of States via ASE Phonon module.

## **Generated Files**
- **Standard Output Files**  
  Generates `OUTCAR`, `OSZICAR`, and `CONTCAR` files in VASP-like formats for downstream compatibility and analysis.
